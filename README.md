# Hello-GitHub
	
I'm pretty boring which is fantastic for you as you'll always upstage me. You're welcome!
I speak English like a true native, which is to say, very poorly.
I also speak conversational French! I'm almost as good as Google translate.
I hope to enter Virtual Production or game developement and use Computer Science to develop procedural programs, maybe even engines!
