# Hello-GitHub
This is my first push to the Github world, so pull my push so we can commit!
I think that's right...
I'm pretty boring which is fantastic for you as you'll always upstage me. You're welcome!
I speak English like a true native which is to say very poorly.
I also speak conversational French! I'm almost as good as Google translate.
As an aspiring computer scientist, I did go to school to earn a degree but was abruptly haulted in light of _The Virus_ situation.
Instead of waiting for my classes to come back, I took it upon myself to continue learning on my own.
I've learned a lot which has boosted my confidence and am itching for an opportunity to deflate my self-esteem!
Lets collaborate together and we can knock out two birds with one stone! Your project, and my ego!
I know a few languages, most recently C# because I'm studying to be a Unity Dev.
I hope to enter Virtual Production or game developement and use Computer Science to develop procedural programs, maybe even engines!
